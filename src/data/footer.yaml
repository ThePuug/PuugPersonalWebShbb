    Established in 1994, we have grown and expanded to cover hundreds of needy families in 
    Mecklenburg County. We are a partner agency with Feed More in Richmond.  This membership allows 
    us to purchase food from them at various discounts and permits us to partner with Food Lion 
    locally, for additional food supplies.
