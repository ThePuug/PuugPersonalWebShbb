    Established in 1994, we have grown beyond a monthly public food
    distribution to also be client specific Homebound food care, and
    emergency homeless food releif. To compliment this outreach, we 
    have created a CARE ( Community Aid Resource Exchange) Program 
    that allows us to help with a variety of resources beyond food.
